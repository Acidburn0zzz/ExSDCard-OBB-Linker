### EOB - ExSDCard OBB Linker Magisk Module - Actually in test stage

This Magisk Module is created to help users to managing their .obb files between their /data, internal and external storage partition, it's usefull for exemple when you change/update your ROM on your device.
Because sometimes theses big files are purelly deleted.

### Pre-requests:
- Android rooted device
- Magisk installed (v16 at least, BETA aren't supported yet)
- External SDCard

### Note:
- This module must to be installed through the Magisk Manager, not compatible with TWRP yet.
- After having install this module, a reboot is required.
- After reboot the phone, you can enter in a live-menu by a terminal emulator app and typing:
`/data/media/eol`
- For now, to warning the user that the long task of moving an .obb file between your internal and external storage, the module play a sound. If you want that an other type of warning was setup, open a pull request with your idea, i will investigate it.


### NB: Any contributions are appreciated :)
